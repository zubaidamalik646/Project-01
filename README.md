Dataset
Car evaluation dataset is provided that has six features and four classes.
1. **Decision Tree Model from scratch**
Dataset has four classes: unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good. Com- bine acceptable, good, very good classes into one and name it acceptable. Thus we would have only two classes: unacceptable and acceptable.
Create a function that divides the entire dataset, allocating 80% of the samples for training and reserving 20% for evaluating the performance of the DT model.
Implemented a function to compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using the test dataset.


2. Naive Bayes
The given dataset has four classes: unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good. Thus, naive bayes classifier should be able to predict class as one of the four (mutli-class classification).
